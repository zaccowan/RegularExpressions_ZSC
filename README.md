# RegularExpression_ZSC

Second assignment for my Compilers course. This project uses Regular Expressions to perfrom some counting and pattern matching over project defined file set.
<br>
Heres an overview of how Regular Expressions are used in this assignment:
  - Pattern matching to count the instances of a predefined set of words (and their other forms) in a given text.
    

# The Assignment Tasks
## Part 1
1. Take the following as an input in plain text form:
     - Frankenstein
     - Dracula
     - Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
     - The Picture of Dorian Gray
     - The Turn of the Screw
     - The Castle of Otranto
2. Count the number of times the following words (and their other forms) occur in each novel:
     - Gloomy
     - Haunting (for example of other formss, pattern would need to also match haunt, haunted, haunts, ...)
     - Mysterious
     - Foreboding
     - Melancholic
     - Terror
     - Desolate
3. For each novel output at file following the form:   <novel_name>_wc.txt
     - A given line if the output file takes the form:   <regex_pattern>|<count>
     - Since there are only 6 words we are search for, there are only 6 patterns, and by extension only 6 lines in each output file
5. In another application, take in all *_wc.txt files and add their contents to a hashmap where
     - the key is <regex_pattern>
     - value is the sum of <count> for a given pattern across all novel files.
